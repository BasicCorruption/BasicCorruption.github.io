  <h1>Server linux "upgrade"</h1>
  <p>
    It is server upgrade time! I decided to switch operating systems instead of upgrading the actual hardware. I chose Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS. Why server edition? Well the old way of accessing my server was VNC (because RCON did not work.) However, with Ubuntu server edition, we can use OpenSSH server and use the built-in SSH client on windows. Linux also has some pretty cool web interfaces. But running a non-graphical OS comes with some issues, with multi-tasking being the biggest. I have been trying to find a solution for this for a while but it hasn't been working. My friend Nathan has been working hard on the server and helping me out a lot.
