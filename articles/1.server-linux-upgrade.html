  <h1>Server linux "upgrade"</h1>
  <p>
    It is server upgrade time! I decided to switch operating systems instead of upgrading the actual hardware. I chose Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS. Why server edition? Well the old way of accessing my server was VNC (because RCON did not work.) However, with Ubuntu server edition, we can use OpenSSH server and use the built-in SSH client on windows. Linux also has some pretty cool web interfaces. But running a non-graphical OS comes with some issues, with multi-tasking being the biggest. I have been trying to find a solution for this for a while but it hasn't been working. My friend Nathan has been working hard on the server and helping me out a lot.

  <h3>So what is the problem?</h3>
  <p>
    If you don't know much about minecraft servers, you probably think that our bungeecord network is running off of one single process. That is not what how a bungeecord network operates. A network is made up a host proxy (running bungeecord) and several smaller spigot servers. The proxy just handles players and them connecting, switching servers, and disconnecting. The spigot servers actually handle the games and worlds. I have a single computer and that will be running a minecraft server and also will be used as a NAS. Forget about the NAS for now since I don't have any hard drives yet. Since a bungeecord network has to run on multiple processes, it would be hard to run a network easily on a non-graphical OS.

  <h3>Possible solutions</h3>
  <p>
    One solution I have considered is virtual machines. The main problem about VMs is networking. I might have figured it out but Nathan says we could possibly use docker.
    My temporary solution (hosting on my main PC) isn't working either. As of right now, I am hosting the server on my main PC with right correct port forwarding settings on both the PC and router but it is not working. However, I did tell Nathan to change some DNS settings on the domain for the new website setup.

  <h3>Even more problems</h3>
  <p>
    Let's put the minecraft server and network problems aside as I will probably be able to fix them tonight. There are more problems. I can't actually put files on the server or modify them in real time. The old way I did this was through windows file sharing. But I can't do that because I am running Ubuntu server. I found out about a program called "samba" and actually tested it on my laptop before installing ubuntu server on my computer in the basement. Samba was working fine on both a VM and my laptop so I thought it would work on the server. I was wrong. I'm getting an error that I think might be related to the windows operating system. I don't remember all of it but it started with "Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user." I have no idea how to fix this but it is a huge issue when initializing the server and also setting up a NAS.
